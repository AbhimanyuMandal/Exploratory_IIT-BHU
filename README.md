##INTRODUCTION 
 
Neurotoxicity refers to the direct or indirect effect of chemicals that damage the brain or peripheral nervous system of humans or animals. Numerous chemicals can produce neurotoxic diseases 
in humans and are known as neurotoxins or neurotoxic agents. By inhibiting the ability of neurons to perform their expected intracellular functions or pass a signal to a neighbouring cell, 
neurotoxins can induce systemic nervous system arrest or even nervous tissue death.  

##Project Objective

In silico prediction of neurotoxicity induced by drugs using machine learning algorithms.
